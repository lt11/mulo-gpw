### block regression

DEG      = 2            # degree of the polynomials to be used in Local Polynomial Regression Fitting
BLK      = 0.2          # block size = BLK * UNIT, e.g. yeast, BLK = 0.2 ; rice, BLK = 20
MIN      = 10           # min total depth in block
MINVALID = 10           # min valid blocks in one chromosome (needed to be at least 10)

# output file determination (optional)
# Result1_File = result/result1.xls	# including allele frequency and threshold
